- Created a [Shiny Admissions dashboard](http://rpubs.com/UTexas80/MDHE) to analyze state institution enrollment trends.
- This is my first venture into creating a web-enabled dashboard with R.
- The source file of the website is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/UTexas80/MU) and is served on [rpubs](http://rpubs.com/UTexas80/MDHE).
