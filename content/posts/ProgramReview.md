- All University units that offer academic programs to University students are reviewed on a seven-year cycle under the Academic Program Review Process for SACS Accreditation.
- As part of this effort, Facilities Inventory is responsible for the creation of reports and CAD floorplans to provide the departments under review with information to validate their location assignments and space occupancy.
- I redesigned the Program Review Annua/l Reporting Process utilizing the AutoCAD api and VBA that resulted in a 80% reduction in processing time.
- Click to see a [*Microsoft Sway presentation*](https://sway.com/w2G8ra8l5zxPFQPd) of the project.
