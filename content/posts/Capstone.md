- The [UGA MIT Program Capstone Project](https://online.uga.edu/node/3933) helps Local Organizations with Technology Needs.
- The project I was involved with was the [Watershed UGA Data Management Portal](https://glencfalk.rbind.io/UGaMIT_Capstone.pdf/).
- [Watershed UGA] (https://www.watershed.uga.edu/) is an initiative aimed at fostering a sense of stewardship and sustainability through increased awareness-- and eventual restoration-- of the mostly hidden streams and lakes of the Athens campus. Part of this project entails real-time monitoring of campus streams via a network of sensors that automatically relay observations to an Internet-connected database. Additionally, a number of faculty, graduate students and undergraduate classes conduct periodic sampling of campus streams and Lake Herrick, but there is no centralized repository for these data. This project created a MySQL database that accommodated multiple classes of observations. A single web portal connected to the Watershed UGA web site that served both real-time and periodic data in a user-friendly fashion to support multiple users: researchers, students, and the general public.
- Here is the [Watershed UGA Data Management User Guide](https://glencfalk.rbind.io/WatershedUGA_UserGuide.pdf/) associated with the project.
